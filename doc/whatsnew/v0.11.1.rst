- |Enhancement| Reduced the use of matplotlib global state in the :ref:`multi-grid classes <grid_api>` (:pr:`2388`).

- |Fix| Restored support for using tuples or numeric keys to reference fields in a long-form `data` object (:pr:`2386`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`lineplot` where NAs were propagating into the confidence interval, sometimes erasing it from the plot (:pr:`2273`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`PairGrid`/:func:`pairplot` where diagonal axes would be empty when the grid was not square and the diagonal axes did not contain the marginal plots (:pr:`2270`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`PairGrid`/:func:`pairplot` where off-diagonal plots would not appear when column names in `data` had non-string type (:pr:`2368`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug where categorical dtype information was ignored when data consisted of boolean or boolean-like values (:pr:`2379`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`FacetGrid` where interior tick labels would be hidden when only the orthogonal axis was shared (:pr:`2347`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`FacetGrid` that caused an error when `legend_out=False` was set (:pr:`2304`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`kdeplot` where ``common_norm=True`` was ignored if ``hue`` was not assigned (:pr:`2378`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`displot` where the ``row_order`` and ``col_order`` parameters were not used (:pr:`2262`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`PairGrid`/:func:`pairplot` that caused an exception when using `corner=True` and `diag_kind=None` (:pr:`2382`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` where `annot=False` was ignored (:pr:`2323`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` where row/col color annotations could not have a categorical dtype (:pr:`2389`).

- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :func:`boxenplot` where the `linewidth` parameter was ignored (:pr:`2287`).

- |Fix| Raise a more informative error in :class:`PairGrid`/:func:`pairplot` when no variables can be found to define the rows/columns of the grid (:pr:`2382`).

- |Fix| Raise a more informative error from :func:`clustermap` if row/col color objects have semantic index but data object does not (:pr:`2313`).
