    "=====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization sometimes involves a step of aggregation or estimation, where multiple data points are reduced to a summary statistic such as the mean or median. When showing a summary statistic, it is usually appropriate to add *error bars*, which provide a visual cue about how well the summary represents the underlying data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several seaborn functions will automatically calculate both summary statistics and the error bars when given a full dataset. This chapter explains how you can control what the error bars show and why you might choose each of the options that seaborn affords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error bars around an estimate of central tendency can show one of two general things: either the range of uncertainty about the estimate or the spread of the underlying data around it. These measures are related: given the same sample size, estimates will be more uncertain when data has a broader spread. But uncertainty will decrease as sample sizes grow, whereas spread will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In seaborn, there are two approaches for constructing each kind of error bar. One approach is parametric, using a formula that relies on assumptions about the shape of the distribution. The other approach is nonparametric, using only the data that you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your choice is made with the `errorbar` parameter, which exists for each function that does estimation as part of plotting. This parameter accepts the name of the method to use and, optionally, a parameter that controls the size of the interval. The choices can be defined in a 2D taxonomy that depends on what is shown and how it is constructed:"
