    "We will discuss three seaborn functions in this tutorial. The one we will use most is :func:`relplot`. This is a :doc:`figure-level function <function_overview>` for visualizing statistical relationships using two common approaches: scatter plots and line plots. :func:`relplot` combines a :class:`FacetGrid` with one of two axes-level functions:\n",
