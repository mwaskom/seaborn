v0.9.1 (Unreleased)
------------------

This is a minor release, comprising mostly bug fixes and compatibility with dependency updates.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``corner`` option to :class:`PairGrid` and :func:`pairplot` to make a grid with only the lower triangle of bivariate axes.

- Generalized the idea of "diagonal" axes in :class:`PairGrid` to any axes that share an x and y variable.

- In :class:`PairGrid`, the ``hue`` variable is now excluded from the default list of variables that make up the rows and columns of the grid.

- Exposed the ``layout_pad`` parameter in :class:`PairGrid` and set a smaller default than what matptlotlib sets for more efficient use of space in dense grids.

Bug fixes and adaptations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Avoided an error when singular data is passed to :func:`kdeplot`, issuing a warning instead. This makes :func:`pairplot` more robust.

- Fixed the behavior of ``dropna`` in :class:`PairGrid` to properly exclude null datapoints from each plot when set to ``True``.

- Fixed an issue where :func:`regplot` could interfere with other axes in a multi-plot matplotlib figure.

- Semantic variables with a ``category`` data type will always be treated as categorical in relational plots.

- Avoided a warning about color specifications that arose from :func:`boxenplot` on newer matplotlibs.

- Adapted to a change in how matplotlib scales axis margins, which caused multiple calls to :func:`regplot` with ``truncate=False`` to progressively expand the x axis limits. Because there are currently limitations on how autoscaling works in matplotlib, the default value for ``truncate`` in seaborn has also been changed to ``True``.

- Relational plots now consider semantics with only a single value that can be interpreted as boolean (0 or 1) to be categorical, not numeric.

- Relational plots now handle list or dict specifications for ``sizes`` correctly.

- Fixed an issue in :func:`pointplot` where missing levels of a hue variable would cause an exception after a recent update in matplotlib.

- Fixed a bug when setting the rotation of x tick labels on a :class:`FacetGrid`.

- Fixed a bug where values would be excluded from categorical plots when only one variable was a pandas ``Series`` with a non-default index.

- Improved support for grouping observations based on pandas index information in categorical plots.

- Fixed a bug when using ``Series`` objects as arguments for ``x_partial`` or ``y_partial`` in :func:`regplot`.

- Fixed a bug when passing a ``norm`` object and using color annotations in :func:`clustermap`.

- Fixed a bug when trying to call :func:`set` while specifying a list of colors for the palette.

- Fixed a bug when resetting the color code short-hands to the matplotlib default.
