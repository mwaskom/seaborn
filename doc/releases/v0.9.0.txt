v0.9.0 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Added the :func:`scatterplot` function for representing the relationship between ``x`` and ``y``, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the points.

- Added the :func:`lineplot` function for representing relationships between``x`` and ``y`` variables with lines, potentially after conditioning on up to three other variables and semantically mapping those conditions with the color, size, or style of the lines. This function replaces :func:`tsplot`, but with an API that is more consistent with other modern seaborn functions and has both more flexibility (more dimensions of semantic mapping, better handling of dates) and less flexibility (fewer options for visual representing uncertainty). There is considerable new API documentation and a few gallery examples.

- Final removal of the previously-deprecated ``coefplot`` and ``interactplot`` functions.

- Fixed :func:`jointplot`/:class:`JointGrid` and :func:`regplot` so that they now accept list inputs.

- Changed :func:`rugplot` to plot a matplotlib ``LineCollection`` instead of many ``Line2D`` objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays.

- Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that ``pip`` is aware of. This means that ``pip install seaborn`` will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions.

- Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>` (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).
