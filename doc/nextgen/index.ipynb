    "## Background and goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This work grew out of long-running efforts to refactor the seaborn internals so that its functions could rely on common code-paths. At a certain point, I decided that I was developing an API that would also be interesting for external users too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, \"write a new interface\" quickly turned into \"rethink every aspect of the library.\" The current interface has some [pain points](https://michaelwaskom.medium.com/three-common-seaborn-difficulties-10fdd0cc2a8b) that arise from early constraints and path dependence. By starting fresh, these can be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "More broadly, seaborn was originally conceived as a toolbox of domain-specific statistical graphics to be used alongside matplotlib. As the library (and data science) grew, it became more common to reach for — or even learn — seaborn first. But one inevitably desires some customization that is not offered within the (already much-too-long) list of parameters in seaborn's functions. Currently, this necessitates direct use of matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've always thought that, if you're comfortable with both libraries, this setup offers a powerful blend of convenience and flexibility. But it can be hard to know which library will let you accomplish some specific task. And, as seaborn has become more powerful, one has to write increasing amounts of matpotlib code to recreate what it is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal is to expose seaborn's core features — integration with pandas, automatic mapping between data and graphics, statistical transformations — within an interface that is more compositional, extensible, and comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "One will note that the result looks a bit (a lot?) like ggplot. That's not unintentional, but the goal is also *not* to \"port ggplot2 to Python\". (If that's what you're looking for, check out the very nice [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package). There is an immense amount of wisdom in the grammar of graphics and in its particular implementation as ggplot2. But I think that, as languages, R and Python are just too different for idioms from one to feel natural when translated literally into the other. So while I have taken much inspiration from ggplot, I've also made plenty of choices differently, for better or for worse."
