    "The most important function for working with discrete color palettes is :func:`color_palette`. This function provides an interface to many (though not all) of the possible ways you can generate colors in seaborn, and it's used internally by any function that has a ``palette`` argument (and in some cases for a ``color`` argument when multiple colors are needed).\n",
    "\n",
    ":func:`color_palette` will accept the name of any seaborn palette or matplotlib colormap (except ``jet``, which you should never use). It can also take a list of colors specified in any valid matplotlib format (RGB tuples, hex color codes, or HTML color names). The return value is always a list of RGB tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, calling :func:`color_palette` with no arguments will return the current default color cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corresponding function, :func:`set_palette`, takes the same arguments and will set the default color cycle for all plots. You can also use :func:`color_palette` in a ``with`` statement to temporarily change the default palette (see :ref:`below <palette_contexts>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally not possible to know what kind of color palette or colormap is best for a set of data without knowing about the characteristics of the data. Following that, we'll break up the different ways to use :func:`color_palette` and other seaborn palette functions by the three general kinds of color palettes: *qualitative*, *sequential*, and *diverging*."

The result is that these visualizations end up being more like a puzzle, and they obscure patterns in the data rather than revealing them.

    "You can also use the seaborn function :func:`diverging_palette` to create a custom colormap for diverging data. (Naturally there is also a companion interactive widget, :func:`choose_diverging_palette`). This function makes diverging palettes using the ``husl`` color system. You pass it two hues (in degreees) and, optionally, the lightness and saturation values for the extremes. Using ``husl`` means that the extreme values, and the resulting ramps to the midpoint, will be well-balanced"
