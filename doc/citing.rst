Citing seaborn
--------------

If seaborn is integral to a scientific publication, please cite it.
A paper describing seaborn has been published in the `Journal of Open Source Software <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021>`_:

    Waskom, M. L., (2021). seaborn: statistical data visualization. Journal of Open Source Software, 6(60), 3021, https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021.

Here is a ready-made BibTeX entry:

.. highlight:: none

::

  @article{Waskom2021,
      doi = {10.21105/joss.03021},
      url = {https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03021},
      year = {2021},
      publisher = {The Open Journal},
      volume = {6},
      number = {60},
      pages = {3021},
      author = {Michael L. Waskom},
      title = {seaborn: statistical data visualization},
      journal = {Journal of Open Source Software}
   }

In most situations where seaborn is cited, a citation to `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/citing.html>`_ would also be appropriate.
